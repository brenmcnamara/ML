    "# Markov Chain\n",

    "This exercise is from the Linear Algebra textbook, *Linear Algebra, Gateway to Mathematics*, originally published in 1994. The problem is defined as Exercise 2 of Section 5.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "*The random walk on a line is a classical example of an absorbing Markov chain. Suppose a particle moves among the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 arranged along a line. From positions 2, 3, and 4 the particle moves one position to the left with probability 1/2 and moves on position to the right with probability 1/2. Positions 1 and 5 are absorbing: once the particle reaches either of these positions, it remains in that position forever.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a computer program to simulate the random walk discussed in this section. Have the program repeat the walk a large number of times and print out the average number of visits to the non-absorbing states as well as the average number of steps until absorption. Compare the results of the algorithm to the theoretical results obtained in this section.*"
