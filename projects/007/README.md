# Probabilistic Graphical Models

This project contains some code to follow along with the lessons from
the Probabilistic Graphical Models textbook. I chose to implement this
using typescript for the following reason:

1. Having a type system is amazing
2. I can run / manage everything from the CLI, no special IDE required.
3. Typescript has great unit testing frameworks to run my code.
4. If I want to display things to the screen, I can do so easily in the
   browser without additional tooling.
