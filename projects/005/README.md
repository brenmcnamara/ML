# Downsampling Method for Classification

In this notebook, I explore some techniques for downsampling data points in a multi-class classification scenario. The two main goals of downsampling are:

1. Fix any imbalances among different classes of data points.
2. Adjust the size of the dataset in the case where there are too many data points (this may be a problem when working with computation limits).

A few methods for downsampling are explored with some basic statistical analysis.
